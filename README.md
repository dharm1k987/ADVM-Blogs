# ADMV - The Blog

##### A unique blogging website hosted on gh-pages.

One day, in a group of four friends, one friend decided to write a blogging website, and so we took the initiative to make his dream come true. 



The developers (Dharmik & Vinit) created this using basic technology that was available at the time, self learning every part of it and letting their imaginations run wild. They are now full time students in University with much more practical real world experience.

### Lo and Behold:

- Our website currently contains simple blogging functionality with changes arriving in the very near future!
- Ability to make and share blogs of life experiences
- You can view the blogs, but you must be a registered user to create

#### Technology

- Javascript
- HTML5/CSS3
