                    This happened last week. You see, my schedule is a wonderful one where I have two days off in a week but that means I have to suffer through three days of packed classes. Three of the five classes being three straight hours of boring, old lectures. I can’t complain though because four days off is too sweet to even frown upon. On Wednesday, I have an 8:00 am class that lasts three hours. Last week I had a very important test for this class and getting there on time was of top priority. Since it’s a one hour commute, I have to wake up at 5:30 am to have enough time to get ready and leave the house. On the night of the previous day, I didn’t take this matter very seriously. I set one alarm for 5:30 and went to bed at 11:30 pm. Notice how I said “went to bed” and not “drift off to sleep”. I lay in bed for about an hour or so before I actually started to sleep. Sound the sirens because this is where everything’s going downhill! Having the full intention of waking up at 5:30 am, I actually did wake up at that time…only to turn off the alarm for good. BIG MISTAKE. I later woke up to a strange feeling in my gut and almost as quickly panic set in. I looked at my watch - 7:02 am. Boom. Game over. Tears, anger, grabbing my hair, shouting. I was strange in those few moments where I learned I was totally and absolutely f***ed. Long story short, I made it in time.

                    Today in my linear algebra class, I went to go sit where Vishwa was sitting since he always comes before me. This time however, when I was about to take a seat beside him, I looked at him and saw something peciular. Vishwa dawg was wearing earphones and listening to a song! As anyone might do, I decided to stop exactly where I was, not make eye contact with him, take out my phone, and sneak in a photo. Obviously he saw this (as I wanted him to), but what he did next shocked me. As I sat next beside him, he took his phone, started dialing my number. He said delete it right now or I call home and tell on you. I kid you not, he was so serious. He said "majhak bahu tayu, abhiyaal delete kar keh gare phone karis tara", meaning, enough is enough, delete it right now or I call home. What I found so shocking was that, even when we piss eachother off to the extreme, we go into our one "modes", we don't talk to one other, we don't look eachother in the eye, but never, ever, do we go to the level of snitching on someone like that, because we've had "enough". I was deeply hurt by this, and I moved to another row, and came right to the computer lab to right about this. It really makes me feel weird. I tease him, he teases me, I call him desi, cheap, he does all this shit to me too. But I never all call him, and with the serious attitude he was in, I could tell he was really going to do it. He told me to delete it, and so being Dharmik, obviously I upload to Google Photo's and then delete it, but it's safe and sound with me right now. What a guy. Couldn't take the heat so decided to complain to the police. Real friends these guys are.

                    Today around 9:30 AM, I went downstairs and met Jainam, he was just leaving. We were walking in the slow and I asked him, "how'd exams go". He's like, "let me tell you the shit that happened". Here is how it goes. Don't read ahead or you won't get the laugh. Read word for word. He had an exam last week, and that week it was super super snowy, icy, the snow was very deep, it was very cold and muddy. It was basically a horrible day to have an exam on. His exam started at 2:30 PM, but he had to leave around 10 AM since York is far. He told me how he usually goes from here to STC, then takes the 199, or some bus like that, and then proceeds his journey from there. That day, look at this man's luck. He went to STC which took way longer then expected. The 199 didn't come. He waited for 20 minutes and just when he was about to take another route, the 199 came. Thank god, right? He went on the 199, and it took him to York, a total trip of 2h he said, and he was exhausted. He reached York about just on time, around 1:45 pm. After all that snow, all that wasted time, he finally made it to school. He entered the school, and his phone vibrated cause of internet, and he opened his phone, and here's what it said. "Exam is canceled due to bad weather. - Prof {}"

                    Well, I got up and immediately continued watching Narcos. Having started it yesterday, I found it greatly interesting and wasted no time in catching up. The reason why I titled this blog The Calm After The Storm is because compared to yesterday’s high energy and resourceful work, today was just a lazy mofo’s average day. Wish I had done something more productive. Tomorrow I plan to read more, play the guitar more and revise my notes. Let’s wish I don’t turn back on my words.

        <h2> Indian Idol Diaster</h2>

                    Indian idol is a show I watch dearly, because singing has always been my passion (Waving flag, except for that member, not naming names here but you know who I mean). Basically this time it was going to be an elimination. The guy that got eliminated today sang the best today, but sang not the best last week. Since the eliminations are based off of last week, he unforuntately did not go through to the top 8. What's sad is that in the song that he sang today, he was singing and went to the singers table where are the singers sit, and while singing, bent down on one knee, and took this girls arm, and started dancing with her. He liked this girl. The girl liked him. The girl's name is Maalvika and the guys name is Hardeep. The girl is a beauty. From maybe the second week everyone could tell that they were a couple, and that they really loved eachother, just from this show. Even when the judges are giving their comments, they give it, and then Hardeep always looks at Maalvika, and she just smiles. All of India knows their love right now, even though it just started through Indian Idol. When the eliminations came, Maalvika and 3 others were already safe, and then 2 more got safe. That lead to the bottom 3, as they call it, with Hardeep, Tajinder (Arjun's cousin), and a girl. When Karan Wahi announced who was safe, it was the girl. The girl who came in as a WILDCARD, even though she was eliminated just 3 weeks ago. Everyone was shocked, but obviously you can't show that. Even the judges were. Then came the moment of truth Tajinder was announced safe, and then the camera angle switches directly to Maalvika. I couldn't help feelings so sad. Not because he lost, but become two lovers were seperated. After Hardeep says thanks and all, Maalvika is the first one that comes to hug him, and all you see is tears running down her face. Then Indian Idol shows us photos of them, and all the times they had together, just them, and then the show ends. It's actually really sad. She has to go on knowing that her love didn't make it ahead. I wish they bring him back. All of India does. She girl should've got out. She's only in cause she's the most beautiful girl you've seen (that's why they even brought her back in wildcard I bet). By the way, Maalvika is south Indian like Mirza.

                    Today was a crazy productive day. It just so happens that on my first day of blogging I work non-stop. While it does make a good first impression, I am usually NEVER like this. For instance, I cleaned out my desk today. Pretty normal stuff right? WRONG. The last time I cleaned out my desk was over 6 months ago! Yeah, so today was a miracle. I got so caught up in my flow of productivity that I decided to clean the entire house, throw out the trash and go shopping for essentials. Pretty normal stuff for an average functioning teenager; but for me... it's like I changed into a whole new person. I should mention that my parents and my lil' bro are abroad. Thus, making this accomplishment an unimaginable feat. While clearing out my horrendous desk, I got to some precious memories of the past...mainly from my classes in high school. A skit I did in grade 11 English class, my humungous binder from Fin. Sec, some scripts I wrote to pass time... I put them all in my stash of precious memories. Overall, I am proud of myself for the stuff I did today and I am proud of Dharmik for coming up with such a great initiative and for working on the HTML. That's it for me today!

                    Today I had my ethics exam. I drank alot of water in my exam but I saw the guy beside me drinking it and I thought I could use some hydration. Turns out I drank a lot of water, and when I was on the bus, my bladder reached it's full point. I raced home, and without properly undressing, let the water loose in the toilet. I counted the glory. 61 seconds.

                    Today is the day after all my exams have finished, and totally being honest with you, there is almost no way to free up time right now. It's totally cold outside, there's nothing to do inside as people are still writing their exams. As such, I am taking my time in the break to learn a thing or two about the foundations of web design, and how it impacts our lives.
